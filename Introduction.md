## Purpose of this notebook

This notebook is not for architectural planning. It is to assist as a reference to Windows Server in migration planning, with plenty of links to old articles, datacenter considerations, etc. Hopefully it will save you time and be a useful shortcut to get to information you need.

Architectural and Planning information is available from these resources...these are referenced throughout this notebook: 
	- The Azure Cloud Adoption Framework - Provides a foundation for planning a migration target environment.
	- Windows Server 2008/SQL Server 2008 Migration Playbooks - 
	- Azure Architectural Design documentation 

DO use this notebook to find resources aimed at specific implementation issues which have already come up with various Azure customers.

You can also read through "Reader's Digest" versions of product overviews and guidance. I have put in quite a few links that you can use to reference source material, learn more, etc.
